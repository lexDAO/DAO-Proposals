# LexDAO as Community Trustmark

## Problem Statement

As per constitution
legal engineer as distinct skillset from _cyberlaw_ practice or _legal technologist_. Currently LexDAO is seen as niche and thus underappreciated (low profile in public goods funding). The #find-a-lawyer channel is getting much lower activity than during COVID and we haven't replaced the talent pool that spunout into KaliDAO.

Community Trustmark [^1] an internationally recognised standard of competency and reliable expertise. Aspiration is within 5-7 years to have LEETH holders to be viewed within client's mind as akin to chartered practising accountant (CPA) and LexDAO the (sole?) leading certification agency.

3. Sale/license-back DAO LLC â†” (Wyoming) LexDAO

<summary>Incentive for mentorship leading to certification</summary>
Law firms have summer internship and courts clerkship. As a practice, we should expose members to web3 processes via the mentor-apprenticeship model and peer recognition of skills. As we can't offer salary nor satisfaction (in administrating justice), we default to satisfaction in being on peripheral of emerging institutions (ECH standards formation) or exposure to thought leadership (Ross Ricardian contracts). We also need to point out the demand for H-shaped skills by cultivating a talent pipeline (which law firms can outsource tasks) or a safe haven for transitional members to build up solo-practices (rogue gallery) with priority referral in #find-a-lawyer channel.
