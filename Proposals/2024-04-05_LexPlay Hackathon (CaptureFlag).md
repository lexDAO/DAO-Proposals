The target audience is decision makers on RetroPGF whilst beneficiaries are the public at large. Hence their search domain ignored the cryptopunk subculture where LexDAO has symbolic, suggestive, and functional traits.

# LexDAO as Community Trustmark

## Problem Statement

As per constitution, legal engineer as distinct skillset from _cyberlaw_ practice or _legal technologist_. Currently LexDAO is seen as niche and thus underappreciated (low profile in public goods funding). The #find-a-lawyer channel is getting much lower activity than during COVID and we haven't replaced the talent pool that spunout into KaliDAO.

Community Trustmark [^3] an internationally recognised standard of competency and reliable expertise. Aspiration is within 5-7 years to have LEETH holders to be viewed within client's mind as akin to chartered practising accountant (CPA) and LexDAO the (sole?) leading certification agency (perhaps in conjunction with Token Engineering Community).

<summary>Legal ownership of the international trademark</summary>
1. USPTO registered trademark

2. WIPO Madrid submission under LexDAO LLC

3. Sale/license-back DAO LLC â†” (Wyoming) LexDAO
</details>

<details>
<summary>Incentive for mentorship leading to certification</summary><br>
Law firms have summer internship and courts clerkship. As a **practice**, we should expose members to web3 processes via the mentor-apprenticeship model and peer recognition of skills. As we can't offer salary nor significance (in administrating justice), we default to satisfaction in being on peripheral of emerging institutions (Ethereum Cat Herder standards formation) or exposure to thought leadership (Ross Ricardian contracts). We also need to point out the demand for H-shaped skills by cultivating a talent pipeline (which law firms can outsource tasks) or a safe haven for transitional members to build up solo-practices (rogue gallery) with priority referral in #find-a-lawyer channel.

### USPTO has refused LexDAO wordmark on grounds of being descriptive

<details>
<summary>xref USPTO commentary and RfQ</summary><br>
- timeline is tight (6 Jun hard as extension already granted)
	
- need sale/licenseback from Ross,
- 
- ratification from LEETH holders (75% supramajority)
</details>

### Crowdsource response for 3(of 5) arms 
<details>
<summary>xref RfQ</summary><br>
- easier to forcefeed legal philosophy to mid-age developers than teach coding;
	
- arms race in AI acquisition will strand laggard law firms
- 
- seek sponsorship from existing law firms with Legal Engineering practice
</details>

### Master Hackathon: DUNA standing under Wyoming and TMEM 2(f) Collective Mark

<details>
<summary>multiple individual marks via unicode variations but font masking</summary>
<br>

LexDAO (without fancy emoji) as a umbrella IP for arbitrary pods.
Members obtaining LEETH-a| (1st gen bar-rogue, 2nd gen neo-class)

- current good practice is a Panama combined foundation + company
- functionally equivalent to DUNA + offshore "Office" (rep/proj Office)
- Corporate Transparency Act does not apply to DUNA - run subsequent HOW2 reflag hackathons
- opportunity to host conversation wrt grandfathering in LEETH and new skill-tree
</details>

> [!CAUTION]
> This assumes that the benefits of being DUNA outweighs the detriments of remaining UNA


### Task Breakdown
Seeking EOI to participate as

1. l'externs working for membership as one of 3 teams;
2. Mentor to mock-play senior counsel on the BountyBoard;
3. paid up member wishing to relook anew at constitution 0.2 -> constitution 0.3 

### Assumptions

1. Need minimum of 6 l'externs, pref 3-5 per team = ~12-15 (no dropouts) max 50 (incl guests)
2. At least 2-3 mentors willing to answer questions (remotely) over weekend
3. The constitution is relatively straight-forward to convert (Member, Letter, Office)

> [!WARNING]
> What assumptions if proven wrong will lead to abandonment

## Proposal

### Task Breakdown
<!-- Graphic form is easier to grok, details in github project-->
[Example](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)
	License-back grandfathers existing LEETHs ... Ross emeritus status? (Lvl 5 Cryptowizard) 
	stewardship of github repos to come under LexDAO (copyright)
	token subsidy wrt KaliDAO
	Control rights over various lex-tokens to Ops as trustee 
	Change of 2FA emails on various social media (and closure if Comms sos decide)

Profile existing LEETH holders and their skills tree as inspiration to members
	1 rogue portrait per month in newsletter
	interview - perhaps a task for (l)externs in work for membership
	ask to nominate best 3 work in legal engineering
	custom-made LexDAO badge

### Outcomes + Key Results 

+ Culture build - assist in target of 250 paid-up members (conversion of guests)
  + Retrospective of early legacy of LexDAO by new l'externs
  + Refactor brand imagery amongst the technical cryto community
  + Reaffirm relationship with leXpunK Army and Token Engineering Community (amicus brief)
+ Sustainability
  + reduce risk - legal validator node for secondary personal trademark registry (delegated) and act as steward for *-engineering 
  + increase income - Master Hackathon to be reused for private DAOs to resettle in Wyoming (convergence)
  + constrain costs Tap into pool of hackers/programmers willing to work for membership to automate Ops (reduce burnout)
+ Scribe lvl 2.0 skill uplifting
  + use of markdown (via googleDoc)
  + transfer to hackMD (dual screen)
  + push to github and progressively familiarise
