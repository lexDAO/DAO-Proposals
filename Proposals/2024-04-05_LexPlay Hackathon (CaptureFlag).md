The target audience is decision makers on RetroPGF whilst beneficiaries are the public at large. Hence their search domain ignored the cryptopunk subculture where LexDAO has symbolic, suggestive, and functional traits.

# LexDAO as Community Trustmark

## Problem Statement

As per constitution, legal engineer as distinct skillset from _cyberlaw_ practice or _legal technologist_. Currently LexDAO is seen as niche and thus underappreciated (low profile in public goods funding). The #find-a-lawyer channel is getting much lower activity than during COVID and we haven't replaced the talent pool that spunout into KaliDAO.

Community Trustmark [^3] an internationally recognised standard of competency and reliable expertise. Aspiration is within 5-7 years to have LEETH holders to be viewed within client's mind as akin to chartered practising accountant (CPA) and LexDAO the (sole?) leading certification agency (perhaps in conjunction with Token Engineering Community).

<summary>Legal ownership of the international trademark</summary>
1. USPTO registered trademark - @dclark tasked to issue 3x RêŸ»Q

2. WIPO Madrid submission under LexDAO LLC

3. Sale/license-back DAO LLC â†” (Wyoming) LexDAO

<summary>Incentive for mentorship leading to certification</summary><br>
Law firms have summer internship and courts clerkship. As a **practice**, we should expose members to web3 processes via the mentor-apprenticeship model and peer recognition of skills. As we can't offer salary nor significance (in administrating justice), we default to satisfaction in being on peripheral of emerging institutions (Ethereum Cat Herder standards formation) or exposure to thought leadership (Ross Ricardian Kontracts, Gabe Sharpio META-LEX). We also need to point out the demand for H-shaped skills by cultivating a talent pipeline (which law firms can outsource tasks) or a safe haven for transitional members to build up solo-practices (rogue gallery) with priority referral in `#find-a-lawyer` channel.

### Crowdsource response for 3(of 5) arms 
<details>
<summary>xref RfQ</summary><br>
- easier to forcefeed legal philosophy to mid-age developers than teach coding;
	
- arms race in AI acquisition will strand laggard law firms
- 
- seek sponsorship from existing law firms with Legal Engineering practice

> [!CAUTION]
> This assumes that the benefits of being DUNA outweighs the detriments of remaining UNA

### Task Breakdown
Seeking EOI to participate as

1. l'externs working for membership as one of 3 teams;
2. Mentor to mock-play senior counsel on the BountyBoard;
3. paid up member wishing to relook anew at constitution 0.2 -> constitution 0.3 

### Assumptions

1. Need minimum of 6 l'externs, pref 3-5 per team = ~12-15 (no dropouts) max 50 (incl guests)
2. At least 2-3 mentors willing to answer questions (remotely) over weekend
3. The constitution is relatively straight-forward to convert (Member, Letter, Office)

> [!WARNING]
> What assumptions if proven wrong will lead to abandonment

## Proposal

### Task Breakdown
as per guthub project

### Outcomes + Key Results

  + increase income - Master Hackathon to be reused for private DAOs to resettle in Wyoming (convergence)
  + constrain costs Tap into pool of hackers/programmers willing to work for membership to automate Ops (reduce burnout)
+ Scribe lvl 2.0 skill uplifting
  + use of markdown (via googleDoc)
